# Personal Finance Dashboard

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: GitHub Pages Deployment Note

**This application cannot be fully deployed on GitHub Pages.** GitHub Pages only serves static content and does not support server-side code execution (Node.js, Express, etc.) or database connections (MongoDB).

**If you're seeing only a "Hello World" or landing page on the GitHub Pages site, this is expected behavior.**

### Recommended Deployment Options:
- **Vercel** (easiest option, see deployment instructions below)
- **Render.com**
- **Heroku**
- **Railway**
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**

Each of these platforms supports Node.js applications and can connect to your MongoDB database.

   - Verify that all dependencies are listed in `package.json`

### Option 2: Deploy to Render.com

1. Create an account on [Render](https://render.com/)
